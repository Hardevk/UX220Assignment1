# Financial
- I would like to gain an independence from my parents in a financial aspect. Having my own place after I graduate University would be very ideal which is why I have been investing over the years. I wouldn't say that I have a high upkeep when it comes to money, I like to think im minimalistic which is why I feel like i can achieve this goal.
