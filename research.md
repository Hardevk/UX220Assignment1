- The article that I read talks about how Portfolios provide a very accurate depiction of the student themselves. The portfolio needs to have a good structure which is something that I definitely do agree with because if you have a bad structure theres no chance your portfolio will be good. One of my goals for my portfolio is to have good flow and a good structure.
